.. admonition:: Solution for Day 1
  :class: toggle

  1. Install ``python``:

    There are (unfortunately) many ways to install ``python``. If you are on
    Windows, you might have searched for "How to install python on Windows?",
    which leads you to `this page
    <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_. After clicking on "Latest
    Python 3 Release", you end up on `this page
    <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/>`_. Although it
    doesn't look like it, you are in the right place. Just scroll down, past
    the Monty Python joke that you are too young to understand and find a link
    that says "Windows x86-64 executable installer". Download and execute the
    installer. You now have ``python`` installed.

  2. Install ``pycharm``:

    This one is simpler: Just follow the links to download ``pycharm`` for your
    operating system and install it.

  3. Open ``pycharm`` and create a new project called "quemono":

    There is really not much more to do than to follow the steps proposed by
    ``pycharm``. Enter the name "quemono" for the project when asked for it. If
    you went with the defaults, you end up having a project with a simple
    program generated for you. Delete the lines in that program, we don't need
    them.

  4. Write your first program that prints "¡Hola Mono!"

    The ``python`` command to print text is called ``print``. It is a
    `function` and just like in math, we give it arguments in round
    parentheses. The text we want to print has to be enclosed in quotation
    marks. All together, this gives:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      print("¡Hola Mono!")

Write a program that asks for your name and then says "!Hola <your name>!".

1. Learn about the ``input`` function.
2. Use ``input`` to read the name and ``print`` to produce the message.
