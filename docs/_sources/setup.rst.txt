Setup

Where you get everything ready to start writing ``python`` programs.

Day 1
-----

We start by installing ``python`` (the programming language we are using) and
``pycharm`` (a tool that makes it easier to write ``python`` programs). After
that, we will write the simplest possible program: a program that does nothing
more than to print "¡Hola Mono!".

.. note::

  1. Install ``python`` (version 3).

    Hint: Search for "Install python on Windows" (or similar for a different
    operating system) and try to figure out how to do it yourself.

  2. Install ``pycharm`` (Cummunity version).

    Hint: Search for "Install pycharm" and follow the link that points to
    "jetbrains.com", the creators of ``pycharm``.

  3. Open ``pycharm`` and create a new project called "quemono"

    Hint: There are a few questions ``pycharm`` is asking when you start it the
    first time. If you don't know better, simply go with the default.

  4. Write your first program that prints "¡Hola Mono!"

    Hint: By default, ``pycharm`` will already create a small sample program
    for you in your new project. Feel free to delete the lines in this program,
    we don't need them. What we want to do is to simply "print" the message
    "¡Hola Mono!. In ``python``, this is done with a command of the same name.
    See if you can figure out how to do it! Once you are ready, click on the
    green triangle on the top of the screen, this will run your program. You
    see the output of your program (and possibly error messages) at the bottom.
